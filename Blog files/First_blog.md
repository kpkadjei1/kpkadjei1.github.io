## Introduction
Hi everyone, my name is Kelvin Adjei. I was born on the 7th of June 1998, to my beautiful parents - Mr Christopher Adjei, a Mechanical Engineer currently working as the CEO of Cedar Focus Engineering Consult, and Mrs Lucy Adjei, my ever sweet loving mom, who doubles as a business woman and beautician - at Valco Hospital in Tema. I belong to a beautiful family of 8, with all 7 other members of the family living in Tema at the moment. I have 5 siblings: Ceaser, Christopher, Cyril, Crystal and Crystabel and I feel very blessed to belong to such a blessed big family. Ceaser is currently a Computer Engineer, Christopher is studying to become a Lawyer, Cyril is in high school, and my twin siblings: Crystal and Crystabel are in Middle school. I lived in Nungua, a small town in Accra for 19 years and moved to the United States to study at Swarthmore College.

My experience as an Engineering and Computer Science major at Swarthmore has been nothing short of special and I am very proud of the growth and development I have been able to go through over the past 4 years. I have met wonderful people, who have given me valuable pieces of advice and shared priceless moments with these people over my stay in the United States. I belong to Club Soccer and Swarthmore LaunchDeck groups on campus. 

During my free time I love to play football with my friends, cook, listen to sports podcasts, watch sports games, listen to music and watch movies. My blogs will mainly feature my opinions on recent sports happenings, especially soccer takes, since I have had experience playing soccer myself and I have good knowledge of the game. I will also be writing educative pieces on good programming practices and reviewing some new technology products as well. I hope you enjoy reading all the pieces I write.
